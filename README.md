# OOP-HotDesk

Project created for JAVA assessment. The program runs on the console with the user selecting options from numbers given by the code running at the moment.
The idea was to create a system to manage the booking of hot desks to be used by the public, booking, giving info about the desk, saying when it's occupied or not and so on.
